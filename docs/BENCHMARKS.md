# Benchmarks

This repo ships two benchmark paths:

## 1. Detector Microbenchmark

Purpose:
- isolate `ArbitrageDetector.detect_for_pair()`
- measure pure comparison latency without socket IO, parsing, or persistence

Command:

```bash
python3 tools/benchmark.py
```

Current output:

```text
iterations=100000
throughput_per_minute=16454491
p50_latency_us=3.42
p95_latency_us=3.88
```

## 2. End-to-End Synthetic Benchmark

Purpose:
- measure ingest-on-socket to arbitrage-opportunity-emitted latency inside one process
- include synthetic websocket receive, JSON parse, book update, and detector invocation

Command:

```bash
python3 tools/bench_e2e.py --iterations 10000
```

Current output:

```text
iterations=10000
opportunities_emitted=10000
throughput_per_minute=1920581
p50_latency_us=16.00
p95_latency_us=17.33
p99_latency_us=27.29
max_latency_us=216.67
```

Notes:
- these numbers are measured under synthetic local load, not against the live internet
- the end-to-end benchmark uses an in-process synthetic websocket server
- the detector microbenchmark is not a valid claim for full pipeline throughput

Raw persisted results live in
[`../artifacts/benchmarks/results.json`](../artifacts/benchmarks/results.json).

## Connected-dashboard burst profiling

For process CPU/RSS, receive-to-detection and sender-to-detection p95/p99,
queue drops, browser frame/long-task measurements, and separate Python/React
profiles, see
[the connected-dashboard investigation](../artifacts/benchmarks/performance/README.md).
This exercises the production handler and an actual production-built React
dashboard; the older synthetic benchmark above does not include those paths.

The current verification summary and remaining live-soak gap are tracked in
[VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md).

## 3. Live Soak Observer

On Windows, run the launcher. It starts the backend, waits for readiness, blocks
system sleep for the duration, samples, and stops the backend on exit:

```powershell
.\tools\run_soak.ps1
```

It defaults to the full 24-hour run at a 60-second sample interval, which gives
roughly 1,441 samples. Shorter runs take `-DurationSeconds` and `-SampleSeconds`.

The observer can also be driven directly:

```bash
python3 tools/soak.py \
  --duration-seconds 86400 \
  --sample-seconds 60 \
  --pid <backend-pid> \
  --output artifacts/benchmarks/soak/soak_YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

Pass the pid of the interpreter actually running `arb.main`. A virtualenv or `uv
run` launcher may re-exec the real interpreter as a child process, and sampling
the launcher reports a flat few-megabyte RSS rather than the backend's memory.
The launcher script resolves this automatically.

The observer samples per-exchange ingest volume, adapter reconnects and gaps,
canonical book eligibility and age, readiness, opportunities, background-task
failures, HTTP failures, recovery durations, and backend RSS. It rewrites the
report after every sample, so an interrupted run still leaves a readable report
marked `in progress`. Shorter durations are useful as smoke tests but must not be
described as the required 24-hour soak.
